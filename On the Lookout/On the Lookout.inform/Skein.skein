        <command xml:space="preserve">On the Lookout</command>
        <result xml:space="preserve">Your ship falls through thick layers of dark clouds. Red flashes illuminate your surroundings. The lights on your console warn you of the dangerously fast approaching energy level zero. As you finally break through the last cloud, you get a glimpse of what awaits you underneath. 
Black planes and sharp cliffs of a dark red shape the landscape. In the east you perceive a massive rock formation, in the west you see a thick blue stream cutting through the plane , illuminating big portions of it in the process. Somewhere to the south there seem to be some sort of industrial constructions, far in the north you believe to recognize cubic shapes that reveal a city. You don't have time to study the landscape much longer. All you concentration is desperately needed as you find a gap in the ghastly cliffs and bring down your ship. Heavy jolting, followed by a sudden blow signalize your landing. 
Your ship's on the ground, and you are too, barely. Welcome to Frizza.

On the Lookout
An Interactive Fiction by Franziska, Daniel, Kevin, Tim, Tobias
Release 1 / Serial number 170623 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Your arrival point. The Flat Rock
 You arrive on a planet called Sitis. The arrival should have been easy because you had the possibility to land on a big flat stone but as you leave your spaceship, you realise that two of your three water container broke down. Without minimum one new watertank you can not continue your journey. Far away in the east you recognise some kind of different rooftops. Maybe someones living there who could help you?

The spaceship also won't take off before it hasn't been properly repaired. But first things first. Without any kind of heat you won't survive this bleakness for long. You tame a look at the command panel in hopes of finding something of use but it doesn't look very good. There's only a single green button on the command panel. What could this mean? Might be worth checking out. I could also go south and check storage.

Turns out this used to be an explorer camp and you instantly feel a little less lonely and also more safe. Seems like a good place to stay for a while and trying not to freeze to death. But where did those explorers go and why did they leave pretty much everything behind? Further investigations of this place also reveal something that looks like a cave entrance underneath that lies underneath the camp.

 You've reached the Desert of Sitis. It gives you two things: First, an impression of what whole Sitis looks like - sandy, dry, with some deep stone canyons and huge rocks afar. But although this planet does not seem to be a place to life, the Desert also gives you the chance to discern that you are not alone. There IS life! When you look north, directly in front of you is a long corrugated iron bridge, guiding over one of those ravines. You can not access the bridge, it is blocked with a barbed wire fence, but straight ahead, at the end you see a majestic sandstone palace. In the bridge's middel, a wooden ladder leads to an enormous square block in the east. Likewise it is built out of stone and gives a somber impression. If you look east from the point you are standing at right now you realise that the canyon When you look south you recognize a lot of small white houses. It seems like people are living there .

As you finally break through the last cloud, you get a glimpse of what awaits you underneath. &#x000A;Black planes and sharp cliffs of a dark red shape the landscape. In the east you perceive a massive rock formation, in the west you see a thick blue stream cutting through the plane , illuminating big portions of it in the process. Somewhere to the south there seem to be some sort of industrial constructions, far in the north you believe to recognize cubic shapes that reveal a city. You don't have time to study the landscape much longer. All you concentration is desperately needed as you find a gap in the ghastly cliffs and bring down your ship.

When you look north, directly in front of you is a long corrugated iron bridge, guiding over one of those ravines. You can not access the bridge, it is blocked with a barbed wire fence, but straight ahead, at the end you see a majestic sandstone palace. In the bridge's middel, a wooden ladder leads to an enormous square block in the east. Likewise it is built out of stone and gives a somber impression. If you look east from the point you are standing at right now you see the kind of a rock mine. In the south you recognise a lot of small white houses surrounded by a rampart.

Slowly you approach an archlike structure, close to one branch of the Flux. As you get nearer you perceive a couple of bulky shapes, guarding the entrance to the structure. Some hundred metes in front of the entrance your companion turns to you. &#x000A;&#x000A;- Try not to look too provoking.&#x000A;&#x000A;You know why while passing the guards: each and every one of them gazes at you.

In the back you spot an opening and a staircase, leading downwards. To the left there is a full board of controls and two figures unhastily operating them. You can't look around any more, as you are approached quickly by an impressive sized person, already bellowing a few direct words with a booming voice.&#x000A;&#x000A; - Dunia! Who is this? Explain yourself!&#x000A;&#x000A;- A guest of sorts. He stumbled about the Ascent when I found him.

Besides, I thought about his use in regard to certain issues, due to his undujulike appearance.&#x000A;&#x000A;Both eyeball you thoroughly for what seems to you like hours. Eventually, the massive Duju makes a quick motion towards Dunia, indicating her to follow him. He shoots a last glance at you.&#x000A;&#x000A;- Don't let yourself be found sniffing around somewhere, it would not contribute to your wellbeing.&#x000A;&#x000A; They march off, disappearing into the opening at the end of the hall.

You must have a rather puzzled look to your face, as Du'un starts to explain soon after. &#x000A;&#x000A;- That is a Flux Extractor, the Techies call them "Scoops". It is used to extract small portions of the Flux and isolate it for examination. If you want to help us out, showing us that you have no evil intent in the process, go and extract two samples of the Flux, one from the current before it passes through this gate, and one after it has done so.

What a cheerful message.&#x000A;&#x000A;He seems to be smiling, but even this gesture becomes a little intimidating, considering his imposing build.&#x000A;&#x000A;- Well then, I think you earned an adequate amount of what you could call trust. Let me show you something.&#x000A;&#x000A;He gently but insistingly points you the way - down the stairs which you have so often seen disappear him in. The opening leads to a rather broad tunnel, lined with blue torches on either side. Curiously but not quite voluntarily you enter the tunnel and proceed to step down the stairs into the darkness, the two Duju right behin you. You descend in silence for a long time . At some point, Dunia briefly raises her voice.&#x000A;&#x000A;- No one other than our people have seen what you will see. I guess one seeks the aspiring relief of someone not involved on either part after such a long time of disappointment.&#x000A;&#x000A;Her voice subsides. You hear a soft rumbling from Du'un.&#x000A;&#x000A;- One might.&#x000A;&#x000A;The echos of the exchange are the last vocal sounds you hear for quite some time. You continue to pass fairly large holes in the tunnel, revealing peeks into great caves, deep ravines and cascades of Flux. Later - you really couldn't tell how long you walked - the tunnel broadens and finally leads to an opening. The view takes your breath as you step into a vast cavern. You are surrounded by a natural basin, filled to a considerable level with bluish liquid. In the middle of the cave you see a physically impossible spectacle: There, in mid air, a large blue orb is flying, constantly producing waves of fluid, which then drop down into the basin, keeping the lake's surface in motion. You realize that the air is shimmering, despite the cold atmosphere. You gaze at the grand orb, when your vision suddenly becomes grainy and parts of it fold, spawning shadows and bright specks where there should be none. You close your eyes and look to the ground, as you open them again your vision returned to normal. The Keeper raises his voice. &#x000A;&#x000A;- Don't let your gaze be caught, or the Flux will consume it. But don't worry, that would have taken a bit longer.&#x000A;&#x000A;That warning could have come earlier.&#x000A;&#x000A;You further decend, approaching the big blue lake, when you become aware of a small stone plateau with the stairwell winding around it. Carefully you follow the two Duju down the last steps to the plateau, in the middle of which a small pond of Flux has gathered. Welcome to the core.&#x000A;Du'un comments your arrival.&#x000A;&#x000A;- That is the core of our Flux. It is the quintessence. Our very being.&#x000A;&#x000A;Flux Core.&#x000A;A huge cavern with a Flux lake at its bottom and a spectacular orb flowing midair, emitting Flux waves. You can't see the tunnel from which you came from. In the middle of the plateau is a small lake, sparkling with a pure sheen. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Excited, you stare at the pool. It shows a rash shiver, a quick swirld, before regaining its calm state. Du'un turns to you, his eyes smiling.&#x000A;&#x000A;- You might want to know - that is a quite good outcome.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;As soon as Du'un finished, the pool again starts to move, first swirling, then seething heavily. The bubbles coming from it become solid in mid-air and drop down again, ghostly arcs of blue smoke emerge from the pool, deep rifts start to form. Unvoluntarily, you take a step back. Just when it seems that the pool would sputter out of its basin the tensions abate, the rifts close and the convulsive motions subside. On turning, you see Du'un holding his staff fixed towards the pool. The last movement goes through the pool, then it falls silent. Suddenly, a small object comes to the surface - a transparent orb with a balanced source of energy inside it: a Pure Flux Orb. &#x000A;Du'un points his staff in the direction of the orb and lifts it out of the pool, without touching it, right into a glass container that Dunia stands ready with. As soon as the orb is in the container, Dunia seals it, holding it triumphantly. Du'un turns to you.&#x000A;&#x000A;- That, now, is something special.&#x000A;&#x000A;You receive a Pure Flux Essence.&#x000A;&#x000A;- Oh, and we will need that back.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dunia takes the Flux Extractor from you, smiling cheekily.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;You start the long ascend, Du'un and Dunia following close behind you. Amazed, you hold the Pure Essence in your hands, aware of its worth.&#x000A;&#x000A;As you finally reach the Flux Gate you see that the operator and staff guards have changed, you must have been down there quite a while.

And farewell.&#x000A;&#x000A;And with that he leaves the Gate, this time heading straight to the north, towards the city.&#x000A;&#x000A;- I couldn't have said it better. Farewell, and be free to look around, should there be a next time, perhaps I will be there.&#x000A;&#x000A;Now Dunia too sets out - her in the direction of the ghastly mountains.
