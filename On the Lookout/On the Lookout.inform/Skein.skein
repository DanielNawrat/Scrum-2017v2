        <command xml:space="preserve">On the Lookout</command>
        <result xml:space="preserve">Your ship falls through thick layers of dark clouds. Red flashes illuminate your surroundings. The lights on your console warn you of the dangerously fast approaching energy level zero. As you finally break through the last cloud, you get a glimpse of what awaits you underneath. 
Black planes and sharp cliffs of a dark red shape the landscape. In the east you perceive a massive rock formation, in the west you see a thick blue stream cutting through the plane , illuminating big portions of it in the process. Somewhere to the south there seem to be some sort of industrial constructions, far in the north you believe to recognize cubic shapes that reveal a city. You don't have time to study the landscape much longer. All you concentration is desperately needed as you find a gap in the ghastly cliffs and bring down your ship. Heavy jolting, followed by a sudden blow signalize your landing. 
Your ship's on the ground, and you are too, barely. Welcome to Frizza.

On the Lookout
An Interactive Fiction by Franziska, Daniel, Kevin, Tim, Tobias
Release 1 / Serial number 170623 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Your arrival point. The Flat Rock
 You arrive on a planet called Sitis. The arrival should have been easy because you had the possibility to land on a big flat stone but as you leave your spaceship, you realise that two of your three water container broke down. Without minimum one new watertank you can not continue your journey. Far away in the east you recognise some kind of different rooftops. Maybe someones living there who could help you?

The spaceship also won't take off before it hasn't been properly repaired. But first things first. Without any kind of heat you won't survive this bleakness for long. You tame a look at the command panel in hopes of finding something of use but it doesn't look very good. There's only a single green button on the command panel. What could this mean?

Turns out this used to be an explorer camp and you instantly feel a little less lonely and also more safe. Seems like a good place to stay for a while and trying not to freeze to death. But where did those explorers go and why did they leave pretty much everything behind? Further investigations of this place also reveal something that looks like a cave entrance underneath that lies underneath the camp.

 You've reached the Desert of Sitis. It gives you two things: First, an impression of what whole Sitis looks like - sandy, dry, with some deep stone canyons and huge rocks afar. But although this planet does not seem to be a place to life, the Desert also gives you the chance to discern that you are not alone. There IS life! When you look north, directly in front of you is a long corrugated iron bridge, guiding over one of those ravines. You can not access the bridge, it is blocked with a barbed wire fence, but straight ahead, at the end you see a majestic sandstone palace. In the bridge's middel, a wooden ladder leads to an enormous square block in the east. Likewise it is built out of stone and gives a somber impression. If you look east from the point you are standing at right now you realise that the canyon When you look south you recognize a lot of small white houses. It seems like people are living there .
