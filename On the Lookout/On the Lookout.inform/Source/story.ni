[Story]

	
When play begins:
	 say 
"Your ship falls through thick layers of dark clouds. Red flashes illuminate your surroundings. The lights on your console warn you of the dangerously fast approaching energy level zero. As you finally break through the last cloud, you get a glimpse of what awaits you underneath. [line break]Black planes and sharp cliffs of a dark red shape the landscape. In the [bold type]east [roman type]you perceive a massive rock formation, in the [bold type]west [roman type]you see a thick blue stream cutting through the plane , illuminating big portions of it in the process. Somewhere to the [bold type]south [roman type]there seem to be some sort of industrial constructions, far in the [bold type]north [roman type]you believe to recognize cubic shapes that reveal a city. You don't have time to study the landscape much longer. All you concentration is desperately needed as you find a gap in the ghastly cliffs and bring down your ship. Heavy jolting, followed by a sudden blow signalize your landing. [line break]Your ship's on the ground, and you are too, barely. Welcome to Frizza.";

[Duju]
After answering Dunia that "Duju" for the first time:
	if Dunia is in the Ascent_Frizza and BlooSympathy is true:
		say "[italic type]- Well then, that's not a bad way to start. Thinking about it - an outsider might be what we need. I'll introduce you to someone, and that is not an invitation.[line break][line break][roman type] With seemingly little effort she climbs down the cliffs to your level, before insistently inviting you to come with her.[line break] Both of you walk through the scraggy landscape, her leading the way with distinct commands. Slowly you approach an archlike structure, close to one branch of the Flux. As you get nearer you perceive a couple of bulky shapes, guarding the entrance to the structure. Some hundred metes in front of the entrance your companion turns to you. [line break][line break][italic type]- Try not to look too provoking.[line break][line break][roman type]You know why while passing the guards: each and every one of them gazes at you. In consideration of the thick armour plates, the rather oversized guns and their radiating blue glow you refrain from making any quick motions.";

		now Du'un is in the Upper Gate_Frizza;
		now the printed name of Dunia is "Dunia";
		say "Inside you find yourself in the midst of a small-sized hall, that doesn't appear to justify any of the expenditure you just encountered. In the back you spot an opening and a staircase, leading downwards. To the left there is a full board of controls and two figures unhastily operating them. You can't look around any more, as you are approached quickly by an impressive sized person, already bellowing a few direct words with a booming voice.[line break][line break][italic type] - Dunia! Who is this? Explain yourself![line break][line break]- A guest of sorts. He stumbled about the Ascent when I found him. I don't think he's a Techie, at least he has a slightly better manners and he keeps his voice down to a sensible level when talking. Besides, I thought about his use in regard to certain issues, due to his undujulike appearance.[line break][line break][roman type]Both eyeball you thoroughly for what seems to you like hours. Eventually, the massive Duju makes a quick motion towards Dunia, indicating her to follow him. He shoots a last glance at you.[line break][line break][italic type]- Don't let yourself be found sniffing around somewhere, it would not contribute to your wellbeing.[line break][line break][roman type] They march off, disappearing into the opening at the end of the hall. You are not guarded, it seems like you could [bold type]look [roman type]around. Of course you could also do as you were told and [bold type]wait[roman type].";

A console and a weapon's rack are in the Upper Gate_Frizza. 

A gun is on the weapon's rack. The description of the gun is "An unfamiliar chunk of metal with a glowing core, you can barely identify it, except for the muzzle. Honestly, you wouldn't even know how to fire it."
Duju Operator 1 and Duju Operator 2 are persons in the Upper Gate_Frizza. The description of Duju Operator 1 is "They seem very focussed. Their bodies pulse with light - something you haven't seen with the other types yet." The description of Duju Operator 2 is "They seem very focussed. Their bodies pulse with light - something you haven't seen with the other types yet."
Instead of taking the console, say "It's huge. Besides, you don't even dare touch it."
Instead of taking the weapon's rack, say "That would be rather unpractical."
Instead of taking the gun for the first time, say "Until now you were considered peaceful. Taking a foreign gun in the middle of a foreign building could change that impression. Think good before taking it."

[Gun]
After taking the gun for the second time, say "Instantly you hear shouts and calls behind you. Before even having the chance to turn, you are brutally knocked over and knocked unconscious by a heavy blow. [line break][line break] For a long time you seem to float through thick dark space, sometimes you feel an edge of something metal painfully thrust into your side. As you awake you find yourself in a small chamber with a sterile atmosphere. Three walls are of blank metal with blue veins in them, the fourth is vitreous and reveals a spectacular view: a vast plaza with mingling crowds of glowing shapes, surrounded by exotic buildings made out of crystal and white metal, transportation vehicles of no known origin and static guards, as heavily armed as the ones you saw before - and all radiating a constant bluish sheen like in a dream. However, as much as you see, as little you hear. The chamber seems to be soundproof. The impressions are overwhelming, you feel the exhaustion coming back and fall asleep where you lie."
[--]

[Console]
The console is unexamined.

Before examining the console for the first time:
	now the description of the console is "A huge oval table, full of ... nothing, actually. All you see is a reflective surface, into which the operators dunk their hands, emitting small waves. Where they touch the surface, you believe to see tiny, interlinked pulses of blue light, like a neural system, but you can't be sure. [paragraph break]As you study the console, the two operators become aware of you, freezing in their motion and watching you suspiciously."

Before examining the console for the second time:
	now the description of the console is "After taking a closer look, you make out that the energy of the Operators seems to be induced into the console. You start to see a pattern in the waves and currents of the reflective surface ... it reminds you of the great Flux currents ... [paragraph break]As you continue to glance at the console, one of the operators pulls his hands out of it and stands up from his chair. Obviously you don't make a good impression by standing there, maybe it would be wise to say something or disengage from the console."

Before examining the console for the third time:
	now the description of the console is "Before you can investigate further, the Operators suddenly burst out, chattering bright metallic sounds all over the hall. Instantly there are guards surrounding you, one of which quickly forces you to your knees and irresistibly renders you immobile with some sort of cuffs. You are carried to one corner of the hall like a very miserable sack of grain. Lying down, relaxing perforce, you await Dunia and Du'un to set you free."
	
After examining the console for the third time:
	now the console is examined;
	now Helplesness is true.

		if Helplesness is true:
			say "In your present condition, that's hardly possible.";
			stop the action.

[Asking Operators]

After asking Duju Operator 1 about anything for the first time:
		say "He directs his gaze towards you, before turning to the other. They seem to speak to one another, though you don't understand anything. The sounds you hear are reverberant, bright clanging, like shaking a thin sheet of iron. Soon after, both of them stop their chatter and continue to operate the console, ignoring you."
After asking Duju Operator 1 about anything:
		say "Apparently he decided to not give any more attention to your attempts of communication."
After asking Duju Operator 2 about anything:
	say "He shortly looks at you, then goes back to his work."


[Waiting]
A Flux Extractor is in the Lower Gate_Frizza. The description of the Flux Extractor is "It resembles some sort of high-tech fishing net, there are buttons and cables, you think you know how to operate it ... maybe."

After waiting in the Upper Gate_Frizza for the first time:
	if Helplesness is false:
		say "You stand still where you were left. Time passes. However, that seems to be the only thing to change.";
	else:
		say "You lie, waiting, contemplating your choices."
After waiting in the Upper Gate_Frizza for the second time:
	if Helplesness is false:
		say "You pass the time looking closer at your surroundings, but you can't interpret all too much from the metallic alien structures. The architecture somewhat reminds you of the spiritual buildings on your home planet, as for the arching walls and the high ceiling. The only thing you hear is the distant, lamish flow of the Flux and the dull sounds of the two operators at the console.";
	else:
		say "Still you lie, your eyes fixed in position due to the fact that your head is fixed as well.  As if that wasn't enough, your punishers turned you to a rather unexciting corner of the room."		
After waiting in the Upper Gate_Frizza for the third time:
	if the console is unexamined:
		now Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza;
		now Du'un is in the Upper Gate_Frizza;
		now Du'un carries the Flux Extractor;
		say "Finally you see the two Duju returning from the opening. As they approach, the big one actually looks amazed by your decent behaviour.[line break][line break][italic type]- It seems like you did as you were told. Maybe you don't have no ill intent after all. Indeed - that is exactly what we're going to find out, if you're willing. But you see, we don't want to force anything on you, you are free to leave. But if you are interested in helping [italic type]us, we would be glad.[paragraph break]";
	else:
		now Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza;
		now Du'un is in the Upper Gate_Frizza;
		say "Finally you hear steps approaching and a booming laughter.[paragraph break][italic type]- A little snoopy, are we? Well, not the worst of traits. Hold still.[paragraph break][roman type]You hear clattering and feel your mobility returning. Stiffly you get up and see the two Duju standing before you. You think you recognize a bit of amusement in the eyes of the bigger one.[paragraph break][italic type]- Don't worry, our guards are very cautious, and our Operators even more so, I am certain you meant no harm, if you would have, you wouldn't be here any more.[paragraph break]";
		now Helplesness is false;
	say "[roman type]He hands you something that distantly reminds you of a fishing net, only is this one almost ridiculously overengineered. You must have a rather puzzled look to your face, as Du'un starts to explain soon after. [paragraph break][italic type]- That is a Flux Extractor, the Techies call them 'Scoops'. It is used to extract small portions of the Flux and isolate it for examination. If you want to help us out, showing us that you have no evil intent in the process, go and extract two samples of the Flux, one from the current before it passes through this gate, and one after it has done so. I am sure you will find the proper locations for this purpose yourself. When you are done or have any questions, return here, Dunia will be to your assistance.[paragraph break][roman type]You receive a [bold type]Flux Extractor[roman type].[paragraph break][roman type]With that, Du'un goes off, quickly descending the stairs at the back of the hall. You are left with a vague task and Dunia, who doesn't look very pleased.[paragraph break][italic type]- To your assitance, eh? Well, better than climbing that awful piece of a mountain, I suppose.[paragraph break]";
	now the player carries the Flux Extractor;
	now Du'un is in the Lower Gate_Frizza.

	if Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza:
		say "[response entry]".
		
Table of Dunia Responses
Topic	Response
"Flux" 	"[italic type]- Yeah, our essence and all that shit. Don't mention it.[paragraph break]"	
"Techies"	"[italic type]- They were settler's, originally. Sadly they chose to defile the Flux with their robots and devices, hence their nickname. We are not at good terms at the moment, our 'Leader' Kollock even is bitterly hostile towards them, as he sees them as heretics.[paragraph break]"
"Kollock"	"[italic type]- Our spiritual leader. Celebrated as god-king. 'He is master, he is Flux'.[paragraph break][roman type]Her tone seems to you tinged with a trace of sarcasm. She looks around, as if to see if nobody is within earshot.[paragraph break][italic type]- Though some appreciate their freedom more than others."

After asking Dunia about "Flux Extractor":
	if Dunia has the Sinkan Cloak:
		say "[roman type]She giggles a bit.[paragraph break][italic type]- It is simple, you will see when you get to the Flux. Just dip it in.[paragraph break][roman type]She shows a devilish grin. Oh, but there's something I can help you with.[paragraph break][roman type]Suddenly Dunia grasps a corner of her leathery clothing and, with one swoosh, unwraps it from her body. Underneath, a sinewy, bluish body comes to appearance.[paragraph break][italic type]- Here, take this, it will prevent the Flux from disintegrating you all too fast.[paragraph break][roman type]The devilish grin emerges again.[paragraph break][italic type]- And stop staring.[paragraph break][roman type]You receive a [bold type]Sinkan Cloak[roman type].";
		now the player carries the Sinkan Cloak;
		now the description of the Sinkan Cloak is "The leather is completely unfamiliar to you. With its wide span you would have expected it to weigh heavy, but it lies lightly in your arms, as if you were carrying only a blanket. There is a little Duju insignia on the back.";
	else:
		say "[roman type]She giggles a bit.[paragraph break][italic type]- It is simple, you will see when you get to the Flux. Just dip it in.[paragraph break][roman type]She shows a devilish grin."

[Weight]
[A weight is a kind of value. 1kg specifies a weight. Everything has a weight. [A thing usually weighs 10kg.]

Definition: A thing is light if its weight is 1kg or less. 
Definition: A thing is heavy if its weight is 10kg or more.

The Energy Orb is light.

Instead of inserting an object into the suit capacitor:
	unless the thing is light;
	say "Fuck you";
	stop the action.]

The player wears a suit capacitor. The description of the suit capacitor is "This capacitor only holds certain types of energy sources which usually maintain the suit's functionality such as protecting the wearer from extreme temperatures. Inserting other energy sources might increase those functions even further or result in a horrible death." The suit capacitor is a container. The carrying capacity of the suit capacitor is 1.
[Global Error Message]

Instead of taking some scenery, say "You don't seem to be strong enough."

[Rooms]
The Spaceship Bridge_Kaldríss is a room.  "The place where all the magic happens. Well, it used to be at least - during the impact most of the important equpiment including the communication systems must have been fried and doesn't seem to work anymore.  There's only a single flickering light inside the command panel. What could this mean? I should probably open the command panel and take a look. I could also go south and check the storage of the spaceship first." The printed name of the Spaceship Bridge_Kaldríss is "Spaceship Bridge".

After going to the Spaceship Bridge_Kaldríss for the first  time:
	say "You got caught in a meteor shower and while trying your best to manouver your spaceship through it  your engine still took a hit. You then had to crash-land on Kaldríss - one of the most cold planets in this solar system.  Since only a few explorers made their to this planet there's not a whole lot of information available about this icy place. You are pretty much on your own now. The spaceship also won't take off before it hasn't been properly repaired. But first things first. Without any kind of heat you won't survive this bleakness for long. You tame a look at the command panel in hopes of finding something of use but it doesn't look very good. There's only a single green button on the command panel. What could this mean? I might also wanna  take a look at the spaceship exit that lies straight ahead since it seems to be busted, too."
	
The Spaceship Storage_Kaldríss is a room. "Taking a quick look inside the storage room doesn't seem to reveal anything particularly interesting. There are only some random souvenirs from your previous intergalactic travels and your locker which you haven't opened in ages.

The printed name of the  Spaceship Storage_Kaldríss is "Spaceship Storage".
The Spaceship Exit_Kaldríss is a room. "The airlock also seems to be affected by the crash and the temperatures inside the spaceship are nearing dangerous levels.

The printed name of the  Spaceship Exit_Kaldríss is "Spaceship Exit".
The Crash Zone_Kaldríss is a room. "The surface of Kaldríss consists of spiky ice formations as far as the eye can see . No wonder nobody in his right mind would try to land here willingly. There doesn't seem to be anything of interest wherever you look. After taking a closer look you suddenly notice some sort of structure north of your position. If you hurry up you should be able to make it there before you freeze." The printed name of the Crash Zone_Kaldríss is "Crash Zone".
The Hunting Grounds_Kaldríss is a room. "Turns out this used to be an explorer camp and you instantly feel a little less lonely and also more safe. Seems like a good place to stay for a while and trying not to freeze to death. But where did those explorers go and why did they leave pretty much everything behind? Further investigations of this place also reveal something that looks like a cave entrance underneath that lies underneath the camp." The printed name of the Hunting Grounds_Kaldríss is "Hunting Grounds".

Gaining the Yetíss trust wasn't easy but in the end you managed to do it and now it's finally time to find a way off this planet! I can see a light above me that seems to be leading to .. some place?

I think I should be good for now if I just keep going west."
