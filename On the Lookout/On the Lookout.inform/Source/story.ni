[Story]

	
When play begins:
	 say 
"Your ship falls through thick layers of dark clouds. Red flashes illuminate your surroundings. The lights on your console warn you of the dangerously fast approaching energy level zero. As you finally break through the last cloud, you get a glimpse of what awaits you underneath. [line break]Black planes and sharp cliffs of a dark red shape the landscape. In the [bold type]east [roman type]you perceive a massive rock formation, in the [bold type]west [roman type]you see a thick blue stream cutting through the plane , illuminating big portions of it in the process. Somewhere to the [bold type]south [roman type]there seem to be some sort of industrial constructions, far in the [bold type]north [roman type]you believe to recognize cubic shapes that reveal a city. You don't have time to study the landscape much longer. All you concentration is desperately needed as you find a gap in the ghastly cliffs and bring down your ship. Heavy jolting, followed by a sudden blow signalize your landing. [line break]Your ship's on the ground, and you are too, barely. Welcome to Frizza.";

After asking Dunia about anything:

After answering Dunia that "Axesto" for the first time, say "[italic type]What a strange name. It doesn't matter anyway - there's only one thing I need to know: are you on the side of the [bold type]Techies [roman type]or of the [bold type]Duju[roman type]?"


[Duju]
After answering Dunia that "Duju" for the first time:
	if Dunia is in the Ascent_Frizza and BlooSympathy is true:
		say "[italic type]- Well then, that's not a bad way to start. Thinking about it - an outsider might be what we need. I'll introduce you to someone, and that is not an invitation.[line break][line break][roman type] With seemingly little effort she climbs down the cliffs to your level, before insistently inviting you to come with her.[line break] Both of you walk through the scraggy landscape, her leading the way with distinct commands. Slowly you approach an archlike structure, close to one branch of the Flux. As you get nearer you perceive a couple of bulky shapes, guarding the entrance to the structure. Some hundred metes in front of the entrance your companion turns to you. [line break][line break][italic type]- Try not to look too provoking.[line break][line break][roman type]You know why while passing the guards: each and every one of them gazes at you. In consideration of the thick armour plates, the rather oversized guns and their radiating blue glow you refrain from making any quick motions.";

		now Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza;
		now Du'un is in the Upper Gate_Frizza;
		now the printed name of Dunia is "Dunia";
		say "Inside you find yourself in the midst of a small-sized hall, that doesn't appear to justify any of the expenditure you just encountered. In the back you spot an opening and a staircase, leading downwards. To the left there is a full board of controls and two figures unhastily operating them. You can't look around any more, as you are approached quickly by an impressive sized person, already bellowing a few direct words with a booming voice.[line break][line break][italic type] - Dunia! Who is this? Explain yourself![line break][line break]- A guest of sorts. He stumbled about the Ascent when I found him. I don't think he's a Techie, at least he has a slightly better manners and he keeps his voice down to a sensible level when talking. Besides, I thought about his use in regard to certain issues, due to his undujulike appearance.[line break][line break][roman type]Both eyeball you thoroughly for what seems to you like hours. Eventually, the massive Duju makes a quick motion towards Dunia, indicating her to follow him. He shoots a last glance at you.[line break][line break][italic type]- Don't let yourself be found sniffing around somewhere, it would not contribute to your wellbeing.[line break][line break][roman type] They march off, disappearing into the opening at the end of the hall. You are not guarded, it seems like you could [bold type]look [roman type]around. Of course you could also do as you were told and [bold type]wait[roman type].";

A console and a weapon's rack are in the Upper Gate_Frizza. 

A gun is on the weapon's rack. The description of the gun is "An unfamiliar chunk of metal with a glowing core, you can barely identify it, except for the muzzle. Honestly, you wouldn't even know how to fire it."
Duju Operator 1 and Duju Operator 2 are persons in the Upper Gate_Frizza. The description of Duju Operator 1 is "They seem very focussed. Their bodies pulse with light - something you haven't seen with the other types yet." The description of Duju Operator 2 is "They seem very focussed. Their bodies pulse with light - something you haven't seen with the other types yet."
Instead of taking the console, say "It's huge. Besides, you don't even dare touch it."
Instead of taking the weapon's rack, say "That would be rather unpractical."
Instead of taking the gun for the first time, say "Until now you were considered peaceful. Taking a foreign gun in the middle of a foreign building could change that impression. Think good before taking it."

[Gun]
After taking the gun for the second time, say "Instantly you hear shouts and calls behind you. Before even having the chance to turn, you are brutally knocked over and knocked unconscious by a heavy blow. [line break][line break] For a long time you seem to float through thick dark space, sometimes you feel an edge of something metal painfully thrust into your side. As you awake you find yourself in a small chamber with a sterile atmosphere. Three walls are of blank metal with blue veins in them, the fourth is vitreous and reveals a spectacular view: a vast plaza with mingling crowds of glowing shapes, surrounded by exotic buildings made out of crystal and white metal, transportation vehicles of no known origin and static guards, as heavily armed as the ones you saw before - and all radiating a constant bluish sheen like in a dream. However, as much as you see, as little you hear. The chamber seems to be soundproof. The impressions are overwhelming, you feel the exhaustion coming back and fall asleep where you lie."
[--]

[Console]
The console is unexamined.

Before examining the console for the first time:
	now the description of the console is "A huge oval table, full of ... nothing, actually. All you see is a reflective surface, into which the operators dunk their hands, emitting small waves. Where they touch the surface, you believe to see tiny, interlinked pulses of blue light, like a neural system, but you can't be sure. [paragraph break]As you study the console, the two operators become aware of you, freezing in their motion and watching you suspiciously.[paragraph break]Anyhow, you could [bold type]examine[roman type] the console further."

Before examining the console for the second time:
	now the description of the console is "After taking a closer look, you make out that the energy of the Operators seems to be induced into the console. You start to see a pattern in the waves and currents of the reflective surface ... it reminds you of the great Flux currents ... [paragraph break]As you continue to glance at the console, one of the operators pulls his hands out of it and stands up from his chair. Obviously you don't make a good impression by standing there, maybe it would be wise to say something or disengage from the console. Still, you could [bold type]examine[roman type] it further."

Before examining the console for the third time:
	if the console is unexamined:
		now the description of the console is "Before you can investigate further, the Operators suddenly burst out, chattering bright metallic sounds all over the hall. Instantly there are guards surrounding you, one of which quickly forces you to your knees and irresistibly renders you immobile with some sort of cuffs. You are carried to one corner of the hall like a very miserable sack of grain. Lying down, relaxing perforce, you await Dunia and Du'un to set you free.";
	else:
		now the description of the console is "You can't make out anything new, the Operators are ridiculously shy."
	
After examining the console for the third time:
	now the console is examined;
	now Helplesness is true.

Before doing something other than waiting in the Upper Gate_Frizza:

		if Helplesness is true:
			say "In your present condition, that's hardly possible.";
			stop the action.

[Asking Operators]

After asking Duju Operator 1 about anything for the first time:
		say "He directs his gaze towards you, before turning to the other. They seem to speak to one another, though you don't understand anything. The sounds you hear are reverberant, bright clanging, like shaking a thin sheet of iron. Soon after, both of them stop their chatter and continue to operate the console, ignoring you."
After asking Duju Operator 1 about anything:
		say "Apparently he decided to not give any more attention to your attempts of communication."
After asking Duju Operator 2 about anything:
	say "He shortly looks at you, then goes back to his work."


[Waiting]
A Flux Extractor is a container in the Lower Gate_Frizza. The description of the Flux Extractor is "It resembles some sort of high-tech fishing net, there are buttons and cables, you think you know how to operate it ... maybe." The Flux Extractor has a carrying capacity 2.

After waiting in the Upper Gate_Frizza for the first time:
	if Helplesness is false:
		say "You stand still where you were left. Time passes. However, that seems to be the only thing to change.";
	else:
		say "You lie, waiting, contemplating your choices."
After waiting in the Upper Gate_Frizza for the second time:
	if Helplesness is false:
		say "You pass the time looking closer at your surroundings, but you can't interpret all too much from the metallic alien structures. The architecture somewhat reminds you of the spiritual buildings on your home planet, as for the arching walls and the high ceiling. The only thing you hear is the distant, lamish flow of the Flux and the dull sounds of the two operators at the console.";
	else:
		say "Still you lie, your eyes fixed in position due to the fact that your head is fixed as well.  As if that wasn't enough, your punishers turned you to a rather unexciting corner of the room."		
After waiting in the Upper Gate_Frizza for the third time:
	if the console is unexamined:
		now Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza;
		now Du'un is in the Upper Gate_Frizza;
		now the console is examined;
		now Du'un carries the Flux Extractor;
		say "Finally you see the two Duju returning from the opening. As they approach, the big one actually looks amazed by your decent behaviour.[line break][line break][italic type]- It seems like you did as you were told. Maybe you don't have no ill intent after all. Indeed - that is exactly what we're going to find out, if you're willing. But you see, we don't want to force anything on you, you are free to leave. But if you are interested in helping [italic type]us, we would be glad.[paragraph break]";
	else:
		now Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza;
		now Du'un is in the Upper Gate_Frizza;
		say "Finally you hear steps approaching and a booming laughter.[paragraph break][italic type]- A little snoopy, are we? Well, not the worst of traits. Hold still.[paragraph break][roman type]You hear clattering and feel your mobility returning. Stiffly you get up and see the two Duju standing before you. You think you recognize a bit of amusement in the eyes of the bigger one.[paragraph break][italic type]- Don't worry, our guards are very cautious, and our Operators even more so, I am certain you meant no harm, if you would have, you wouldn't be here any more.[paragraph break]";
		now Helplesness is false;
	say "[roman type]He hands you something that distantly reminds you of a fishing net, only is this one almost ridiculously overengineered. You must have a rather puzzled look to your face, as Du'un starts to explain soon after. [paragraph break][italic type]- That is a Flux Extractor, the Techies call them 'Scoops'. It is used to extract small portions of the Flux and isolate it for examination. If you want to help us out, showing us that you have no evil intent in the process, go and extract two samples of the Flux, one from the current before it passes through this gate, and one after it has done so. I am sure you will find the proper locations for this purpose yourself. When you are done or have any questions, return here, Dunia will be to your assistance.[paragraph break][roman type]You receive a [bold type]Flux Extractor[roman type].[paragraph break][roman type]With that, Du'un goes off, quickly descending the stairs at the back of the hall. You are left with a vague task and Dunia, who doesn't look very pleased.[paragraph break][italic type]- To your assitance, eh? Well, better than climbing that awful piece of a mountain, I suppose.[paragraph break]";
	now the player carries the Flux Extractor;
	now Du'un is in the Lower Gate_Frizza.

After asking Dunia about a topic listed in the Table of Dunia Responses:
	if Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza:
		say "[response entry]".
		
Table of Dunia Responses
Topic	Response
"Flux" 	"[italic type]- Yeah, our essence and all that shit. Don't mention it.[paragraph break]"	
"Techies"	"[italic type]- They were settler's, originally. Sadly they chose to defile the Flux with their robots and devices, hence their nickname. We are not at good terms at the moment, our 'Leader' Kollock even is bitterly hostile towards them, as he sees them as heretics.[paragraph break]"
"Kollock"	"[italic type]- Our spiritual leader. Celebrated as god-king. 'He is master, he is Flux'.[paragraph break][roman type]Her tone seems to you tinged with a trace of sarcasm. She looks around, as if to see if nobody is within earshot.[paragraph break][italic type]- Though some appreciate their freedom more than others."
"Du'un"	"[italic type]- My father and the Keeper of the Flux, if you didn't notice. He taught me to keep an open mind for things, even if his own mental flexibility starts to crumble at the moment."
"Duju"	"[italic type]- Our people. We have lived on this surface as long as we remember, and that indeed is a long time. We never were the star-seeking sort, due to our connection to the Fluxes. You may have noticed the bluish glow and the glowing bodyparts, they pretty much tell on that fact."

After asking Dunia about "Flux Extractor":
	if Dunia has the Sinkan Cloak:
		say "[roman type]She giggles a bit.[paragraph break][italic type]- It is simple, you will see when you get to the Flux. Just dip it in.[paragraph break][roman type]She shows a devilish grin. Oh, but there's something I can help you with.[paragraph break][roman type]Suddenly Dunia grasps a corner of her leathery clothing and, with one swoosh, unwraps it from her body. Underneath, a sinewy, bluish body comes to appearance.[paragraph break][italic type]- Here, take this, it will prevent the Flux from disintegrating you all too fast.[paragraph break][roman type]The devilish grin emerges again.[paragraph break][italic type]- And stop staring.[paragraph break][roman type]You receive a [bold type]Sinkan Cloak[roman type].";
		now the player carries the Sinkan Cloak;
		now the description of the Sinkan Cloak is "The leather is completely unfamiliar to you. With its wide span you would have expected it to weigh heavy, but it lies lightly in your arms, as if you were carrying only a blanket. There is a little Duju insignia on the back.";
	else:
		say "[roman type]She giggles a bit.[paragraph break][italic type]- It is simple, you will see when you get to the Flux. Just dip it in.[paragraph break][roman type]She shows a devilish grin."
		
After putting on the Sinkan Cloak:
	now CloakWearing is true.
	
A Miserable Lever is in the Underground Flux_Frizza. The description of it is "Really not that glamourous, but it will serve."

After asking Dunia about "Gun":
	if the Monolithic Rock is examined:
		say "[italic type]- Ah, I see, you look for a way to get down to the current. Well, the gun is not what will help you, even if I gave it to you, which I won't, you still needed to fire it, which you can't. So erase that thought. However ... what might help you ... wait a moment.[roman type][paragraph break] Dunia turns to the rack, which the gun lies on, and resolutely approaches it. With a few precise movements she breaks loose one of the bars framing the rack, accompanied by a bright clang. Even the guards take a short glance, before respectfully turning to the entrance again. Triumphantly, Dunia returns to you and hands you the bar with a smirk. [paragraph break][italic type]- Congratulations, you are now the owner of a convenient lifting tool.[paragraph break][roman type]You receive a [bold type]Miserable Lever[roman type].";
		now the player has the Miserable Lever;
	else:
		say "[italic type]- A bit of weaponry, typical for our fabrication. It wouldn't be of much use to you, unless you know how to operate a Duju gun. Assuming we would let you take it in the first place."

You perceive magnetic fields, penetrated by some foreign control. You feel the stream, the Flux arranging itself, its symbioses with the planet. You feel the life essence of the Duju, feeding from the Flux. And you feel its core, more powerful than any other source you ever knew, burried deep down in the caverns. Still you have a slim link to your body, but it trembles and shakes heavily. Finally, your hear a tedious, enduring beeping sound. The Flux Extractor is finished, it now carries a sample of the Flux. You force yourself to crawl down the pedestal, your hands feeling like they would disintegrate any moment, their contours growing hazy.

What a cheerful message.[paragraph break][roman type]He seems to be smiling, but even this gesture becomes a little intimidating, considering his imposing build.[paragraph break][italic type]- Well then, I think you earned an adequate amount of what you could call trust. Let me show you something.[paragraph break][roman type]He gently but insistingly points you the way - down the stairs which you have so often seen disappear him in. The opening leads into a rather broad tunnel, lined with blue torches on either side.The three of you for a long time descend in silence. At some point, Dunia briefly raises her voice.[paragraph break][italic type]- No other than Duju have seen what you will see for quite some time. I guess one seeks the aspiring relief of someone not involved on either part, after such a long time of disappointment.[paragraph break][roman type]Her voice subsides. You hear a soft rumbling from Du'un.[paragraph break][italic type]- One might.[paragraph break][roman type]The echos of the exchange are the last vocal sounds you hear for quite some time. Some time after - you really couldn't tell how long you walked - the tunnel broadens and finally leads to an opening. The view takes your breath as you step into a vast cavern from inside the tunnel. You barely can recognize its highest point. You are surrounded by a natural basin, filled to a considerable level with bluish liquid. In the middle of the cave you see a physically impossible spectacle: There, in mid air, a large blue orb is flying, constantly producing waves of fluid, which then drop down into the basin, keeping the lake's surface in motion. You realize that the air is shimmering, despite the cold air. You gaze at the grand orb, when your vision suddenly becomes grainy, parts of it are folding, spawning shadows and bright specks where there should be none. You close your eyes and look to the ground as you open them again, your vision returned to normal. ";

Chapter 5 - Kaldríss

Section 1 - Crash Site

[Finding a way off the space ship]

[Axesto is a person. The Player is Axesto.] 

[Weight]
A weight is a kind of value. 10kg specifies a weight. Everything has a weight. A thing usually has weight 100kg. 

suit capacitor has a weight called breaking strain. The breaking strain of suit capacitor is usually 50kg. Definition: suit capacitor is bursting if the total weight of things in it is greater than its breaking strain. 

The energy orb has weight 50kg.

[Suit Capacitor]
Every turn when suit capacitor held by  Axesto is bursting: 
	say "The [suit capacitor] is only meant to only pure energy and nothing else. Inserting anything else destroys it. You discard its ruined remains, looking miserably down at [the list of things in the suit capacitor] on the floor."; 
	now all of the things in the suit capacitor are in the location; 
	now the suit capacitor is nowhere. 

The player wears a suit capacitor. The description of the suit capacitor is "This capacitor only holds certain types of energy sources which usually maintain the suit's functionality such as protecting the wearer from extreme temperatures. Inserting anything other than pure energy e.g. matter of all sorts will most likely destroy the capacitor and might even result in a horrible death.  Caution is advised here!" The suit capacitor is a container. The carrying capacity of the suit capacitor is 1.

Before inserting the energy orb into the suit capacitor:
	say "Do I really wanna do this? Chances of me dying are quite high. On the other hand, I will probably die anyway if I don't try.";
	continue the action.

[Protector Glove/Electricity]

A protector glove is a thing and wearable. The description of the protector glove is "This protector glove is made out of a special  rubber compound that temporarily absorbs any kind of energy thus protecting its wearer."

A thing can be safe or electrified. A thing is usually safe.

This is the electrocution-wisdom rule:
	if the player wears the protector glove, make no decision;
	if the action requires a touchable noun and the noun is electrified, say "I really shouldn't be touching [the noun] without something that protects my hands." instead;

The electrocution-wisdom rule is listed before the basic accessibility rule in the action-processing rules.

After taking the energy orb:
	say "This could really work!";
	continue the action.


[Global Error Message]

Instead of taking some scenery, say "You don't seem to be strong enough."
Instead of going nowhere, say "You don't want to go there."

[Region - Crash Site]

The Crash Site_Kaldríss is a region.The Spaceship Bridge_Kaldríss, the Spaceship Storage_Kaldríss, the Spaceship Exit_Kaldríss, the Hunting Grounds_Kaldríss and the Crash Zone_Kaldríss are in Crash Site_Kaldríss.

	say "Even though this is a highly experimental weapon it might prove useful at some point."
The food ration is in the Spaceship Storage_Kaldríss.  The description of the food ration is "Smells kinda weird. It's super nutritious though!"
Before taking the food ration:
	say "Bringing food with you is never a bad idea."]
[The Götti is in the Spaceship Storage_Kaldríss. The description of the Götti is "Who would've thought you and your fellow Götti would end up here? On the coldest planet this solar system has to offer. He must be freezing."
Before taking the Götti:
	say "I'm really impressed by how adaptive this creature is. The cold doesn't seem to bother it at all and it even seems like it want's to come with me."]
[The smoke nodule is in the Spaceship Storage_Kaldríss. The description of the smoke nodule is "You picked one of these up during your escape from Gaisetto. That was one hell of an escape!"
Before taking the smoke nodule:

The secret storage is a container. The secret storage is fixed in place. It is closed, locked and openable. The description of the secret storage is "There is a reason this storage compartment is well hidden inside the command panel. Whatever is in there must be of great importance for this spaceship." The green button unlocks the secret storage. In the secret storage is an energy orb. The energy orb is an electrified thing. The description of energy orb is "If used correctly this energy orb creates a warm energy that withstands even the coldest temperatures. It also emits a specific light that only certain creatures are able to see. You are not one of them.". The energy orb can be taken.

The fried communicator is fixed in place.
The encryption key is in the secret storage. The encryption key can be taken.

[Button]
The green button is a device. It is in the command panel. It is switched off. Instead of pushing the green button: if the green button is switched off, try switching on the green button; otherwise try switching off the green button. The green button is fixed in place.

After switching on the green button:

Before taking the emergency torch:
	say "This baby will light up no matter how harsh the conditions are since it uses a special fuel for the ignition process."


[Rooms]
The Spaceship Bridge_Kaldríss is a room.  "The place where all the magic happens. Well, it used to be at least - during the impact most of the important equpiment including the communication systems must have been fried and doesn't seem to work anymore.  There's only a single flickering light inside the command panel. What could this mean? I should probably open the command panel and take a look. I could also go south and check the storage of the spaceship first." The printed name of the Spaceship Bridge_Kaldríss is "Spaceship Bridge".

After going to the Spaceship Bridge_Kaldríss for the first  time:
	say "You got caught in a meteor shower and while trying your best to manouver your spaceship through it  your engine still took a hit. You then had to crash-land on Kaldríss - one of the most cold planets in this solar system.  Since only a few explorers made their to this planet there's not a whole lot of information available about this icy place. You are pretty much on your own now. The spaceship also won't take off before it hasn't been properly repaired. But first things first. Without any kind of heat you won't survive this bleakness for long. You tame a look at the command panel in hopes of finding something of use but it doesn't look very good. There's only a single green button on the command panel. What could this mean? I might also wanna  take a look at the spaceship exit that lies straight ahead since it seems to be busted, too."
	
The Spaceship Storage_Kaldríss is a room. "Taking a quick look inside the storage room doesn't seem to reveal anything particularly interesting. There are only some random souvenirs from your previous intergalactic travels and your locker which you haven't opened in ages.  It also looks like the airlock in the south doesn't seem to function anymore so perhaps I should go check that out as well?" The printed name of the  Spaceship Storage_Kaldríss is "Spaceship Storage".
The Spaceship Exit_Kaldríss is a room. "The airlock also seems to be affected by the crash and the temperatures inside the spaceship are nearing dangerous levels. I could leave the spaceship right now by going east but I if I don't have something to protect me from the cold I will probably die." The printed name of the  Spaceship Exit_Kaldríss is "Spaceship Exit".
The Crash Zone_Kaldríss is a room. "The surface of Kaldríss consists of spiky ice formations as far as the eye can see . No wonder nobody in his right mind would try to land here willingly. There doesn't seem to be anything of interest wherever you look. After taking a closer look you suddenly notice some sort of structure north of your position. If you hurry up you should be able to make it there before you freeze." The printed name of the Crash Zone_Kaldríss is "Crash Zone".
The Hunting Grounds_Kaldríss is a room. "Turns out this used to be an explorer camp and you instantly feel a little less lonely and also more safe. Seems like a good place to stay for a while and trying not to freeze to death. But where did those explorers go and why did they leave pretty much everything behind? Further investigations of this place also reveal something resembling a cave entrance that lies underneath the camp." The printed name of the Hunting Grounds_Kaldríss is "Hunting Grounds".

[Remove stone plate to enter cave]
[Beschreibung von Yundar's Cave ohne stone plate!]
The stone plate is above Yundar's Cave. The stone plate is a door. The stone plate is closed and openable.  The description of the stone plate is "This stone plate looks really heave but if I manage to shove it aside just a little bit I should be able to get past it."





Stoneplateopen is a truth state that varies.  Stoneplateopen is false.

After opening the stone plate:

Understand "shove aside [something] " as opening.
	Understand "put [something] back in place" as closing.

After closing stone plate:
	say "This thing is heavy! I was able to put it back in place though."

Before opening the stone plate:

Section 2 - Yetíss Cave System

[Region - Yetíss]

[Regional Travel?]
Yetíss Caves System is a region.  Main Cave_Kaldríss, Yundar's Cave, Yarwol's Cave and Secret Cave_Kaldríss is in Yetíss Caves System.

[Rooms]
[Yundar's Cave]
Yundar's Cave is a room. "This is one of many caves which the Yetíss have built under the surface of Kaldríss. This one seems to belong to a young female Yetíss called Yundar.  It also connects to another cave if you go further in the east."

After going to Yundar's Cave for the first  time:
	say "Upon trying to make your way into the small cave entrance you slipped and went all the way down. Apart from a few scratches here and there you seem to be okay even though your head hurts quite a lot. You can barely see from where you landed but you see light a little further ahead and decide to go there. It's getting easier to see with every step you take and suddenly you hear noises. It sounds like someone is .. talking? You can't really understand what they are saying since it seems to be some ancient language but you heard the words [italic type]Yundar[roman type] and [italic type]Yarwol[roman type] being thrown around a couple of times so maybe those are names? Perhaps it's even humans who live down here. Maybe it's one of the explorers from the camp above you. This would certainly explain where they went. On the other hand it could also be something entierly else so you should still be really careful when wandering around. The last thing you heard were steps heading east."

[Yarwol's Cave]
Yarwol's Cave is a room. "This cave is where Yarwol, the oldest Yetíss, resides. You wonder how many more of these caves exist. What if there are so many caves that you will get lost and never see daylight again? What if one of those creatures finds you and eats you for breakfast? You better drop that negativity and start figuring out how to escape this place."

After going to Yarwol's Cave for the first time:
	say "You sneakily followed one of the mysterious creatures. Luckily nobody has noticed you. So far so good. Now it's time to find out how you could get out of here.  You take a look around this cave and notice these suspicious rocks. You can't help but feel like someone is trying to hide something behind them so probably you should try to very carefully shove them aside and see if your suspicions turn out to be true."


[Main Cave]
The Main Cave_Kaldríss is a room. "This is like the central cave that also acts as kind of a hub for all the Yetíss that live inside this cave system. Judging from the sheer size of it there must be hundreds of different caves down here." The printed name of the Main Cave_Kaldríss is "Main Cave".

After going to the Main Cave_Kaldríss for the first time:
	say "Looks like this is the cave that connects them all which also explains why it's that much bigger than the ones before.  You can also notice a tiny gap in the east wall. Directly next to it is a small hole in the wall that seems to have a very specific shape. It could be some kind of key hole. If this assumption is true and this turns out to be a door of some kind then this might also be the way out of this cave system.".

[Secret Cave]
Secret Cave_Kaldríss is a room. "A secret cave that even most of the Yetíss don't know about. Only the ones worthy enough are allowed to enter." The printed name of the Secret Cave_Kaldríss is "Secret Cave". 

Before going to Secret Cave_Kaldríss for the first time:
	say "You got the keystone so you should be able to open this door somehow. Not quite sure how to use it though. Let's just hope for the best.";
	stop the action.

After going to Secret Cave_Kaldríss for the second time:
	say "A door magically opens and  eventually you are able to enter the secret cave in the east. Getting past the Yetíss undetected wasn't easy but in the end you managed to do it and now it's finally time to find a way off this planet! I can see a light above me that seems to be leading to .. some place? I should probably follow it before I get lost in the void."


[Follow Yetíss]

A person has a room called last location.

Understand "follow [any person]" as following. Understand the commands "chase" and "pursue" as "follow".

Following is an action applying to one visible thing.

Check following:
	if the noun is the player, say "Wherever you go, there you are." instead;
	if the noun is visible, say "[The noun] is right here." instead;
	if the last location of the noun is not the location, say "It's not clear where [the noun] has gone." instead.

Carry out following:
	let the destination be the location of the noun;
	if the destination is not a room, say "[The noun] isn't anywhere you can follow." instead;
	let aim be the best route from the location to the destination;
	say "(heading [aim])[line break]";
	try going aim.

[NPCs]
Yundar is a woman in Yundar's Cave. "This specimen seems to be one of the younger Yetíss.  Looks chummy but at the same time terrifying to some extent."
Yarwol is a man in Yarwol's Cave.  "Seems like this is the oldest one of them all. This creature looks like it has seen better days since it seems to be very old. It's even possible it has been here for the past century if not longer."

To move (pawn - a person) tidily to (target - a room):
	now the last location of the pawn is the holder of the pawn;
	move the pawn to the target.

[Follow Yundar]

Every turn:
	let current location be the location of Yundar;
	let next location be [Yarwol's Cave]a random room which is adjacent to the current location;
	if Yundar is visible, say "Yundar heads to [the next location].";
	move Yundar tidily to next location;
	if Yundar is visible, say "Yundar arrives from [the current location]."

[Follow Yarwol]

Every turn:
	let current location be the location of Yundar;
	let next location be [Yarwol's Cave]a random room which is adjacent to the current location;
	if Yarwol is visible, say "Yarwol heads to [the next location].";
	move Yarwol tidily to next location;
	if Yarwol is visible, say "Yarwol arrives from [the current location]."




[Directions]
Hunting Grounds_Kaldríss is above stone plate.
Yundar's Cave is west of Yarwol's Cave.
Main Cave_Kaldríss is south of Yarwol's Cave.
